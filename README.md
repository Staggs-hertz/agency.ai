# 🎯 React + Tailwind Learning Project

This project was built while following a YouTube tutorial to learn **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.
I used it as a hands-on way to understand how React components, props, and Tailwind utilities work together.

---

## 📚 What I Did

* Watched the tutorial step-by-step
* Created my own GitHub repo to track my progress
* Researched new concepts and syntax along the way
* Added personal comments in the code to explain what I learned
* Made small edits and improvements to the original code
* Deployed the final version to see it live

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

* How React components and props are structured
* How Tailwind utility classes speed up styling
* Setting up a React project (via Vite or CRA)
* Using GitHub for version control and documentation
* Deploying a React project online (Netlify / Vercel)
